# **Loops**

## **Opdracht 1**

    Create a new script.
    Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
    Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. 
    After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. 
    The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.
