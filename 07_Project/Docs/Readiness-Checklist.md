Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Ready checklist

Before you start building and deploying solutions using Azure services, you need to prepare your environment. The Cloud Adoption Framework provides actionable guidance to reduce the effort required to get ready. For your convenience, this guide is online, in the Azure portal, & in this checklist.

Checklist

Following these steps will help better prepare your environment.

# 1. Readiness Guide  
Learn the pre-requisite tools & approaches important to all adoption efforts.

- Organize resources. Set up a management hierarchy to consistently apply access control, policy, and compliance to groups of resources and use tagging to track related resources.

- Manage access. Use role-based access control to make sure that users have only the permissions they really need.

- Manage costs and billing. Identify your subscription type, understand how billing works, and see how you can control costs.

- Plan for governance, security, and compliance. Enforce and automate policies and security settings that help you follow applicable legal requirements.

- Use monitoring and reporting. Get visibility across resources to help find and fix problems, optimize performance, or get insight to customer behavior.

- Stay current with Azure. Track product updates so you can take a proactive approach to change management.

# 2. First Landing Zone 

Deploy a blueprint to establish your first migration landing zone

- Review compliance requirements and architecture complexity to understand the limitations of this first landing zone.

- Create a blueprint from the “CAF Migration landing zone” sample. Assign that blueprint.

# 3. Expand the blueprint 
Identify landing zone considerations required to personalize the blueprint

- Understand the components of a landing zone across compute, network, storage, data, governance, & Azure primitives.

- Evaluate the decision trees for any of these which will require changes to complete the first landing zone.

# 4. Best Practices 
Leverage well defined best practices as a guide for expanding the blueprint

- Review the best practices for guidance on implementing the considerations.

- After the blueprint is updated to reflect your requirements, the environment will be ready for migration to begin.
